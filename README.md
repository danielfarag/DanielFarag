# 🚀 My DevOps Journey: From Code to Cloud and Beyond ☁️

Hello! I'm Daniel, a Junior DevOps Engineer on a mission to continuously learn, automate, and optimize. My passion lies in understanding how software is built, delivered, and operated, and I'm always looking for ways to make that process smoother and more efficient.

---

### Where I'm Coming From & Where I'm Going 🗺️

My journey started with a strong interest in software development. Now, I'm fully immersed in the world of DevOps, eager to contribute to robust infrastructure, seamless deployments, and scalable systems.

---

### Skills I'm Sharpening 🛠️

* **IaC:** Terraform, Ansible
* **Containerization:** Docker (Actively learning Kubernetes)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins
* **Scripting:** Python, Bash
* **Cloud:** AWS (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM)
* **Monitoring:** Grafana, Prometheus

---

### My Latest Adventures (Projects) 📂

* **3-tier application deployment with github-actions**: Provision 3 tier application infrastructure with public/private subnets, security groups, NAT and SSM for configuration. Implement a simple CI/CD using Github actions.
* **Private Network for Jenkins Slaves**: Engineered private Jenkins slave connectivity via VPC Endpoints and AWS Systems Manager (SSM). Achieved highly secure and scalable environment with no direct network exposure from the master.
* **GitOps Pipeline on AWS**: Build a production-ready CI/CD pipeline on AWS using Terraform for infrastructure, Jenkins for CI, ArgoCD for GitOps-driven CD, and External Secrets for secure credential management.

### What I'm Learning Next 🧠

* Deep dive into [Specific Kubernetes concept, e.g., "Helm charts," "Service Meshes"]
* Exploring [New CI/CD tool, e.g., "ArgoCD"]
* Understanding [Specific cloud service, e.g., "AWS Lambda for serverless architectures"]
